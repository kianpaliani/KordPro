Kord Pro may also collect personal information for administrative reasons, e.g. to provide individuals with publications or other requested information, concerning attendees to conferences or other functions.<br><br>","\t\tKord Pro commits to collecting only personal information, which is directly related to an operating program or activity of Kord Pro. Wherever possible, such information will be collected directly from the individual about whom it pertains.

The form of consent may vary depending on the circumstances and the type of information being sought. Consent can be express or implied and can be provided directly by the individual or by an authorized representative. Express consent of individuals is preferable and will be sought whenever possible. Express consent can be given orally, electronically or in writing. Implied consent may be reasonably inferred from an individual’s action or inaction (i.e. providing a name and address in order to receive a publication, providing a name and telephone number in order to obtain a response to a question). When determining the appropriate form of consent, Kord Pro will take into account the sensitivity of the personal information at issue, the purposes for which it is collected, and the reasonable expectations of the individual.<br><br>","\t\tIn the context of investigations conducted under the Privacy Act or PIPEDA, obtaining consent from an individual for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information may not be possible, appropriate or required. Further, both the Privacy Act and PIPEDA provide for the disclosure of personal information during the course of an investigation if to do so is necessary to carry out an investigation under those Acts and/or to establish the grounds for findings and recommendations contained in the Privacy Commissioner’s report.","\t\t<br><br>","\t\t<b>Accuracy / Correction of Personal Information</b>","\t\t<br><br>","\t\tKord Pro will not require that individuals utilize the Privacy Act in order to correct their personal information if there is no need to do so (e.g. to update the individual’s address on a mailing list).

If an individual is able to demonstrate that his/her personal information is inaccurate or incomplete, Kord Pro will amend the information as required. If appropriate, Kord Pro will send the amended information to third parties to whom the information has been disclosed.<br><br>","\t\tCorrection of opinion will normally be made if the individual was the source of the opinion and the opinion does not concern any other individual. Corrections will not normally be made to opinions given by other individuals about the individual unless there are reasons to suspect the reliability of the source of the opinion, or if the source of the opinion agrees that the opinion was based on incorrect information.<br><br>","\t\tWhen a challenge regarding the accuracy of personal information is not resolved to an individual’s satisfaction, Kord Pro will annotate the personal information at issue with a note advising that a correction was requested but that it was not made.

Kord Pro is committed to seeking the consent of individuals whenever possible. Kord Pro—when using personal information for a new purpose—will document the new purpose.<br><br>","\t\tKord Pro will not disclose personal information outside of Kord Pro without the consent of the individual about whom the information pertains, or unless to do so is permitted by section 8(2) of the Privacy Act. In the case of a permitted disclosure, Kord Pro will endeavour to disclose only the specific information that is required under the circumstances and, wherever possible, will inform the individual about the disclosure.<br><br>","\t\tAccess to personal information within Kord Pro will be restricted to those within Kord Pro who need the information in order to carry out their specific job duties (e.g. conduct investigations, answer inquiries, send publications). Those employees will maintain the information in the strictest of confidence and will not provide access to the information to any unauthorized persons. The level of access to personal information will be determined by Kord Pro on a need-to-know basis which will be included in relevant Kord Pro policies and guidelines.<br><br>","\t\tKord Pro staff will be cautioned to avoid engaging in discussions involving personal information in any area of Kord Pro premises, or in any public or private area outside of Kord Pro (e.g. hallways, elevators, restaurants, washrooms, homes) where remarks could be overheard and which could result in the disclosure of personal information. Doing so without a legitimate reason directly related to a current job responsibility will be considered a violation of this Policy and could constitute a violation of the Privacy Act.<br><br>","\t\tAll individuals hired under contract or other means, by Kord Pro, to conduct business for or on behalf of Kord Pro, will be required to adhere to the provisions of the Privacy Act with respect to the proper handling and protection of personal information as well as to this Policy and internal procedures.

Kord Pro will follow the requirements of the Government Security Policy and any other security direction and/or guidance provided by the Treasury Board Secretariat, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Communications Security Establishment Canada on physical and information technology security. At a minimum, methods of protection will include:","\t\t<br><br>","\t\t• controlled entry to Kord Pro premises, staff training on privacy and the protection of personal information, and limiting access to information on a “need-to-know” basis;","\t\t<br><br>","\t\t• screening and security checks of employees and prospective employees commensurate with the sensitivity of the information those employees will be handling, before they handle such information;","\t\t<br><br>","\t\t•technical measures such as passwords, audit trails, encryption, firewalls and other technical security safeguards;","\t\t<br><br>","\t\t• physical measures such as locked filing cabinets, restricted access to offices and other areas where personal information is stored.","\t\tKord Pro will ensure that contractual or other means are used to provide a comparable level of protection while personal information is being processed by a third party.","\t\t<br><br>","\t\t<b>Access to Personal Information</b>","\t\t<br><br>","\t\tKord Pro will not require that individuals utilize the Privacy Act to obtain access to their personal information if there is no need to do so. Individuals nevertheless have the right to formally request access to their personal information under the Privacy Act. Under the Access to Information Act, individuals also have the right to formally request access to information in Kord Pro files, which may contain their personal information.<br><br>","\t\tKord Pro staff will be required to direct individuals who wish formal access to their personal information to Kord Pro’ Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Unit.

To the extent possible, Kord Pro will inform the individual of the reasons why the personal information no longer exists.","\t\t<br><br>","\t\t<b>Complaints / Concerns</b>","\t\t<br><br>","\t\tAs it is inappropriate that Kord Pro investigate its own actions with respect to its administration of the Privacy Act, complaints lodged against Kord Pro under the Act are investigated by the Privacy Commissioner, ad hoc—an individual mandated to independently investigate such complaints against Kord Pro. Given that a formal complaint mechanism is in place with respect to the Act, this section of the Policy speaks only to questions or concerns which may be raised about Kord Pro’ management of personal information.<br><br>","\t\tSuch questions or concerns may be brought to the attention of any Kord Pro employee who is in a position to address the matter. If unable to do so, or where particular circumstances exist, the employee must refer the matter to his/her immediate supervisor or member of management staff.
